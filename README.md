# fate

Probably going to turn into some satellite tracker or something

I have most of the TLE parsing and the SGP algorithm implemented. I "verified" with lizard-tail as I was not able to come up with the same test values as the SpaceTrack #3 report said I should have come up with, but there's really only one way to know for sure: implement ECI to geodosic conversion and check with real-life.

Currently a WIP project.
